# Pizza-app
This is a small full stack app that allows you to create custom pizza orders, calculates their price and save them in a list.

I used .Net for backend and React for frontend.

How to use the website:

Select your pizza size.
Select your pizza toppings. You must select at least one.
Press "Calculate Price" to see the price of the pizza.
Press "Save Order" to save the order. You must calculate the price first.
Press "Your Orders" to see all orders that you have saved.
Press "Pizza Shop" to go back the pizza shop.
